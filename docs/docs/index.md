# clip_layerwise_alignments documentation!

## Description

This project explores layer-wise alignment in CLIP by training projection layers that map intermediate representations from one encoder to final outputs from the other encoder. The central question: Is alignment a shallow operation on rich representations, or does it require deep semantic processing throughout the network?
